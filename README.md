The changes that were made to the code are as follows:

I did not drop age column from the data

I imported and added RANSACRegressor, TheilSenRegressor, LinearRegression, and HuberRegressor classifiers. These classifiers were chosen so that outliers didnt have an effect on the prediction.

I chose no hyper parameters for LinearRegression, and I used the alpha and epsilon parameters for Huber Regressor.
